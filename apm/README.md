# Tools

Holds some of the tools that I am making at the moment. Most of the tools are scripts that I wrote/am writing. Included are also some various template files.

## APM
This is an NPM wrap-around. This scripts allows one to organize their NPM dependencies
much more cleanly than is possible using stand-alone NPM. E.g. this script allows one to
save all Gulp related dev dependencies under gulpDependencies in package.json

####Usage
apm install package1 package2 package3 --save-gulp
